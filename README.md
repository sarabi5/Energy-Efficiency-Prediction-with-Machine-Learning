Project Workflow: 1) Data Preprocessing, 2) Regression Models (including linear regression, random forest, and multi-output DL model), 3) Model implementation using hyperparamer tunning and k-fold cross validation 4) Model evaluation using R squared, RMSE and MAE, 5) Model interpretability using feature importance analysis, and 6) Model comparison
